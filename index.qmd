In the heart of New York City, the subway is more than just a mode of transportation; it's the lifeline that connects the vibrant communities of this bustling metropolis. Our fascination with this network led us to choose the MTA Turnstile Data for our project. This dataset is not just numbers and statistics; it's a narrative of the city's rhythm, reflecting the daily ebb and flow of its inhabitants. By analyzing this data, we aim to uncover the patterns of subway usage, identify peak travel periods, and understand station popularity. These insights are crucial for urban planners, policymakers, and everyday commuters. The questions driving this study include: Which stations see the highest foot traffic? What are the busiest times of day? This project is a journey through the veins of New York City, decoding the pulse of its subway system.
