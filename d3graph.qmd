  The X axis on this graph are the different subway routes. The Y axis tells us about the rider population on those different routes. 
  
  Through this graph, we wish to show how the population of riders change through the hours. We notice that during the peak hours, train routes such as the 1 train and the R train seem to increase exponentially. This can be attributed to the fact that people require to travel to work, university, etc. Overall, the ridership is a lot lower post 1am, and starts to pick up by 6am the next morning.
