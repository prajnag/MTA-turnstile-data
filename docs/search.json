    "text": "1 Introduction\nIn the heart of New York City, the subway is more than just a mode of transportation; it’s the lifeline that connects the vibrant communities of this bustling metropolis. Our fascination with this network led us to choose the MTA Turnstile Data for our project. This dataset is not just numbers and statistics; it’s a narrative of the city’s rhythm, reflecting the daily ebb and flow of its inhabitants. By analyzing this data, we aim to uncover the patterns of subway usage, identify peak travel periods, and understand station popularity. These insights are crucial for urban planners, policymakers, and everyday commuters. The questions driving this study include:\nWhich stations see the highest foot traffic? How do subway traffic patterns vary across different days of the week? What are the busiest boroughs? What are the busiest stations during peak travel times?\nThis project is a journey through the veins of New York City, decoding the pulse of its subway system."

    "text": "2.1 Description\n\n2.1.1 Research Plan\n1. Data Import and Cleaning: - We will import the MTA Turnstile dataset into R utilizing the readr package for seamless data reading. - We will carry out preliminary cleaning to maintain data quality. This includes addressing missing values, verifying and correcting data types, and resolving any anomalies resulting from maintenance or special events. - We will also validate the integrity of the pre-applied filters to ensure the dataset’s relevance to our analysis.\n2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): - Utilizing dplyr for data wrangling and ggplot2 for visualization, we will conduct an initial exploration to grasp the dataset’s structure and content. - We will generate summary statistics that will aid in understanding the distribution of ridership and spotlighting any immediate patterns or outliers within the data.\n3. Traffic Analysis by Stations and Boroughs: - Data will be summarized by stations using R’s aggregation functions to pinpoint those with the most significant foot traffic. - A borough-level analysis will be performed to identify which parts of the city show higher activity levels. - Findings will be visualized using bar charts and maps to provide clear and engaging representations of our data.\n4. Time Series Analysis: - We will create time series plots, enabling us to examine the variations in subway traffic patterns across different days and times.\n5. Peak Period Identification: - By aggregating ridership data, we aim to identify peak travel times accurately. - Clustering techniques, such as k-means clustering, will be employed to categorize time periods into high, medium, and low ridership clusters.\n6. Statistical Testing: - We will apply chi-squared tests and other relevant statistical tests to investigate the relationships between categorical variables such as payment method and ridership, allowing us to draw meaningful inferences from the data.\n7. Interpreting Results: - The results will be interpreted in light of the original research questions posed. - A detailed discussion of our findings will be provided, considering the implications for urban planning and policy-making. - Our conclusion will summarize the study’s outcomes and propose recommendations for further research or potential applications of our findings in real-world scenarios."

    "text": "2.2 Missing value analysis\nIn our examination of the MTA dataset, a focused analysis on the presence of missing values has been conducted. Our findings are encapsulated in two key visualizations: a bar chart and a proportional representation of missing data by borough.\nThe bar chart delineates a significant prevalence of missing entries predominantly in the New.York.Zip.Codes variable, towering over the Counties variable, which exhibits a relatively minor quantity of missing data. This pattern indicates that while most data points are complete for the majority of the variables, the collection or recording of zip codes has been inconsistent.\nUpon further investigation, portrayed in the proportional missing data by borough graph, it is evident that the missingness in New.York.Zip.Codes does not discriminate by borough, suggesting that the lack of zip code data is a systemic issue rather than a localized anomaly. The Counties variable, although also affected by missingness, shows a much lesser degree of absence across the boroughs.\nConsidering our project’s goals to study subway usage trends, the importance of stations, and busy travel times, the detailed location information from zip codes and counties isn’t really necessary. We’ve decided that the broader location data from the ‘borough’ variable is enough for our geographical analysis. So, we’re going to take out the ‘New.York.Zip.Codes’ and ‘Counties’ variables to keep our analysis clear.\n\n\nCode\nmtadata &lt;- read.csv(\"mtadata.csv\", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\nmissing_values_count &lt;- colSums(is.na(mtadata))\nmissing_values_df &lt;- data.frame(variable = names(missing_values_count), missing_count = missing_values_count)\nggplot(missing_values_df, aes(x = variable, y = missing_count)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = 'blue') +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  labs(x = \"Variables\", y = \"Count of Missing Values\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Missing Data Count per Variable\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmtadata$Missing_Zip_Code &lt;- is.na(mtadata$New.York.Zip.Codes)\n\n\nmtadata$Missing_Zip_Code &lt;- NULL\nmtadata$timestamp &lt;- NULL\n\nmissing_by_borough &lt;- mtadata %&gt;%\n  group_by(borough) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    Proportion_Missing_Zip = mean(is.na(New.York.Zip.Codes)),\n    Proportion_Missing_County = mean(is.na(Counties))\n  ) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = starts_with(\"Proportion_Missing\"),\n    names_to = \"Variable\",\n    values_to = \"Proportion_Missing\"\n  )\n\n\nggplot(missing_by_borough, aes(x = borough, y = Proportion_Missing, fill = Variable)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = position_dodge()) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(x = \"Borough\", y = \"Proportion Missing\", title = \"Proportion of Missing Data by Borough\") +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set1\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))"
