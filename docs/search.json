    "text": "1 Introduction\nIn the heart of New York City, the subway is more than just a mode of transportation; it’s the lifeline that connects the vibrant communities of this bustling metropolis. Our fascination with this network led us to choose the MTA Turnstile Data for our project. This dataset is not just numbers and statistics; it’s a narrative of the city’s rhythm, reflecting the daily hustle and flow of its inhabitants. By analyzing this data, we aim to uncover the patterns of subway usage, identify peak travel periods, and understand station popularity. These insights are crucial for urban planners, policymakers, and everyday commuters. The questions driving this study include:\nWhich stations see the highest foot traffic? How do subway traffic patterns vary across different days of the week? What are the busiest boroughs? What are the busiest stations during peak travel times?\nThis project is a journey through the veins of New York City, decoding the pulse of its subway system."

    "text": "2.2 Missing value analysis\nIn our examination of the MTA dataset, a focused analysis on the presence of missing values has been conducted. Our findings are encapsulated in two key visualizations: a bar chart and a proportional representation of missing data by borough.\nThe bar chart delineates a significant prevalence of missing entries predominantly in the New.York.Zip.Codes variable, towering over the Counties variable, which exhibits a relatively minor quantity of missing data. This pattern indicates that while most data points are complete for the majority of the variables, the collection or recording of zip codes has been inconsistent.\nUpon further investigation, portrayed in the proportional missing data by borough graph, it is evident that the missingness in New.York.Zip.Codes does not discriminate by borough, suggesting that the lack of zip code data is a systemic issue rather than a localized anomaly. The Counties variable, although also affected by missingness, shows a much lesser degree of absence across the boroughs.\nConsidering our project’s goals to study subway usage trends, the importance of stations, and busy travel times, the detailed location information from zip codes and counties isn’t really necessary. We’ve decided that the broader location data from the ‘borough’ variable is enough for our geographical analysis. So, we’re going to take out the ‘New.York.Zip.Codes’ and ‘Counties’ variables to keep our analysis clear.\n\n\nCode\nmtadata &lt;- read.csv(\"mtadata.csv\", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\nmissing_values_count &lt;- colSums(is.na(mtadata))\nmissing_values_df &lt;- data.frame(variable = names(missing_values_count), missing_count = missing_values_count)\nggplot(missing_values_df, aes(x = variable, y = missing_count)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = 'blue') +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  labs(x = \"Variables\", y = \"Count of Missing Values\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Missing Data Count per Variable\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmtadata$Missing_Zip_Code &lt;- is.na(mtadata$New.York.Zip.Codes)\n\n\nmtadata$Missing_Zip_Code &lt;- NULL\nmtadata$timestamp &lt;- NULL\n\nmissing_by_borough &lt;- mtadata %&gt;%\n  group_by(borough) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    Proportion_Missing_Zip = mean(is.na(New.York.Zip.Codes)),\n    Proportion_Missing_County = mean(is.na(Counties))\n  ) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = starts_with(\"Proportion_Missing\"),\n    names_to = \"Variable\",\n    values_to = \"Proportion_Missing\"\n  )\n\n\nggplot(missing_by_borough, aes(x = borough, y = Proportion_Missing, fill = Variable)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = position_dodge()) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(x = \"Borough\", y = \"Proportion Missing\", title = \"Proportion of Missing Data by Borough\") +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set1\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))"

This could imply higher ridership, more frequent services, or possibly more data collection points on these routes. Brooklyn (BK) and Queens (Q) also display a fair range of records across routes but do not reach the peaks seen in Manhattan. The Bronx (BX) shows less variation, indicating a more uniform level of data records across the routes. Staten Island (SI), on the other hand, has far fewer routes, and the data suggests a relatively lower level of records, which could reflect fewer services or a lower population using transit services."

Brooklyn (BK) and Queens (Q) follow a similar pattern, with steady ridership numbers that do not fluctuate much from day to day. The Bronx (BX) shows lower ridership compared to Brooklyn and Queens, but it follows the same trend of consistency across the week. Staten Island (SI) has the lowest ridership figures of all, indicating fewer people use public transportation there, or there may be fewer transportation options available.\nThis data suggests that public transportation is heavily utilized in Manhattan, possibly due to a high concentration of workplaces, attractions, and residential areas, necessitating daily travel. The consistency in ridership numbers across the week, including weekends, could imply that the city’s transit system is integral to the daily lives of its residents, not just for commuting but also for other activities."

The vertical axis is on a logarithmic scale, indicating a wide range of ridership numbers, which allows for the comparison of values that differ greatly in magnitude.\nFrom the graph, it’s evident that the MetroCard is still a widely used payment method across all boroughs, showing a substantial number of riders using it. The OMNY system, which is a newer contactless payment option, also shows significant usage, with its adoption rate seemingly close to that of the MetroCard in certain boroughs like Manhattan and the Bronx. Notably, in Queens and Staten Island, MetroCard usage appears to be more prevalent than OMNY, which might indicate a slower transition to the newer technology or a preference for traditional payment methods in these areas.\nThis visualization provides insights into the adoption rates of different payment technologies across the city and can inform transit authorities about current trends in commuter payment preferences."

The vertical axis shows the average ridership, which quantifies the number of riders per route within each borough.\nFrom this visual, we can infer several points. Manhattan (M) has the highest average ridership across the most transit routes, which could suggest that it is the most heavily trafficked borough in terms of public transportation, likely due to being a central business district with numerous attractions and residential areas. Brooklyn (BK) and Queens (Q) have a moderate level of average ridership, with a variety of routes used. The Bronx (BX) has the lowest average ridership among the four boroughs shown, with fewer routes represented.\nThis chart could indicate the distribution and utilization of transit services in each borough. For instance, the data might reflect that Manhattan’s transit system is extensively used across many routes, showing the borough’s reliance on public transportation. For Brooklyn and Queens, the diversity in route usage suggests a well-distributed transit network catering to various parts of the boroughs. The lower ridership in the Bronx could point to less frequent or less utilized transit services."

Stations like “West 4 St,” “Fulton St,” and “Broadway- Lafayette St” are among the busiest, with the highest number of average daily riders. These stations are likely to be major transit hubs or are located in densely populated areas or central business districts with high footfall. On the other end of the spectrum, stations like “Bay Pkwy,” “Alabama Av,” and “Broad Channel” have significantly lower ridership numbers, indicating they are less frequented by commuters, possibly due to their location in less busy areas or because they serve as local stops rather than major transfer points.\nThis information is particularly useful for city planners and transit authorities to identify where to focus resources and improvements. It can also inform potential infrastructure expansions or targeted marketing campaigns to increase ridership in less-utilized areas"

One notable trend is a peak or trough during certain months for different boroughs, which could correspond to seasonal events, changes in service levels, or other factors influencing how many people take public transport. For example, Brooklyn shows a significant rise in ridership in August, while the Bronx experiences a dip during the same period. Manhattan’s line appears to have a general downward trend as the year progresses, which might indicate a decrease in commuters or tourists during these months. Queens and Staten Island show less dramatic changes, but still display some variability.\nThis data can be valuable for transit planners to anticipate demand, adjust service, and plan for future infrastructure needs."

For instance, on Fridays (red bars), there seems to be a significant increase in ridership during certain hours, perhaps corresponding to the end of the workweek when people may go out more. The patterns on weekdays (Monday through Friday) show two spikes, likely illustrating the morning and evening rush hours. On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), the ridership increases more gradually and doesn’t have the distinct peaks of the weekdays, suggesting a more even distribution of travel throughout the day.\nThis information is useful for understanding how transit demand varies throughout the week and can be essential for scheduling, staffing, and service planning."

The lack of intersection between lines suggests that there are no routes in this dataset that are shared between boroughs; each route is unique to its borough. This could indicate a transit system where boroughs operate somewhat independently, or it could be a visual abstraction that does not account for connections or transfers between routes.\nFrom this graph, we can infer that the transit system is potentially segmented by borough, with each area having distinct routes. The absence of inter-borough routes may reflect a focus on intra-borough connectivity, or it might be a limitation of the dataset or the specific visualization technique used. For urban planners and transit authorities, such a graph could highlight the potential need to improve inter-borough connectivity if such routes are indeed lacking, or it could validate a strategy that prioritizes strengthening transport within each borough"

The vertical axis measures the total ridership in a numeric format (which appears to be in the hundreds of thousands based on the scale), and the horizontal axis lists the station complexes. This graph helps to identify which stations have the highest demand during peak hours, information that can be critical for transit authorities for resource allocation, scheduling, and improving services. It can also indicate the flow of commuter traffic and highlight potential areas for infrastructure development."

    "title": "4  Interactive graph - How Ridership changes over the Hours for Different Subway Routes",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Note: This graph may take a second or two to load.\nThe X axis on this graph are the different subway routes. The Y axis tells us about the rider population on those different routes.\nThrough this graph, we wish to show how the population of riders change through the hours. We notice that during the peak hours, train routes such as the 1 train and the R train seem to increase exponentially. This can be attributed to the fact that people require to travel to work, university, etc. Overall, the ridership is a lot lower post 1am, and starts to pick up by 6am the next morning."

    "text": "These are some of the inferences we can draw from the plots we constructed.\n\nRidership Over Time: The graph shows fluctuations in ridership across different days, reflecting typical patterns of subway usage. It likely indicates higher ridership on specific days, which could correspond to workdays, suggesting a commuting pattern among subway users.\nRidership by Borough: The ridership distribution among boroughs highlights which areas have higher subway usage. This information is crucial for transit planning, as it indicates where the demand for subway services is concentrated.\nBusiest Stations During Peak and Non-Peak Times: This comparison reveals key transit hubs that are particularly busy during peak hours, likely due to work-related commuting, and stations that maintain steady ridership, possibly serving residential areas or tourist attractions.\nRidership Distribution by Hour of Day: The ridership trend throughout the day shows peak usage hours, which are typically aligned with morning and evening commuting times. This pattern is essential for scheduling and resource allocation in the subway system.\nRidership by Payment Method: The analysis of payment methods used for ridership offers insights into the popularity and adoption rate of different payment options, such as OMNY and MetroCard. It could also reflect user convenience and technological trends.\nWeekday vs Weekend Ridership Patterns: The comparison between weekdays and weekends suggests different ridership behaviors, likely with more work-related travel during weekdays and leisure or personal errands during weekends.\nHeatmap of Transfers at Different Stations: This heatmap likely identifies stations with high transfer activities, indicating major junctions in the subway system. These stations are critical points for connectivity and passenger flow within the network.\nVariability and Outliers of Ridership Among Different Boroughs: The boxplot indicates the consistency or variance in ridership among different boroughs, with outliers highlighting days with unusually high or low ridership, possibly due to special events or disruptions.\n\nOverall, these graphs collectively provide a comprehensive understanding of the New York City subway system’s usage patterns. They reveal important insights into daily and weekly transit rhythms, commuter behaviors, payment preferences, and the subway network’s key hubs. This information is invaluable for transit authorities for effective management, planning, and enhancement of subway services."
